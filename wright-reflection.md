What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I believe the concepts I was initially struggling with using Git was dealing with branch merging, pull requests, and dealing with merge conflicts.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
All of them were clarified and explained.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
The questions I asked were in relation to how each of the commands we were not familiar with (git fetch) worked, as well as the nuances of certain aspects of GitHub such as the pull requests and resolving merge conflicts when they occur.

What still confuses you about Git?
Nothing I can think of comes to mind, although it is likely I may encounter aspects or events within Git that we haven't previously experienced.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first experience was smooth, easy to follow along, and fun to participate in. Both my pair as well as my guide were helpful and cooperative in accomplishing what needed to be done, as well as covering each of the discussions within the challenge.
