What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I knew what all the concepts were but needed to solidify the timing and flow of each command.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

How merge conflicts are resolved. Also, how pull requests work when collaborating, how easily it is for one team member to get another's changes.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

What's the difference between fetch, merge, and pull?
Can you break down the command git push origin master? Does github automatically know which origin its pointing to?

What still confuses you about Git?

I feel like I have a decent handle on the basics so far.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was a great resource to steer us in the right direction and answer both technical questions, and how the commands work within an actual team.
